"""Pydantic in 30 minutes — everything Lab 1 needs, and nothing else.

    python labs/lab1/pydantic_primer.py              # run the checks
    python labs/lab1/pydantic_primer.py --solutions  # show the answers

You already know Python. This is not a tutorial on classes or type hints. It is
eight exercises covering the exact Pydantic surface Lab 1 uses:

    BaseModel · Field(ge, le, pattern, max_length, default, description)
    Literal · `| None` · field_validator · ValidationError
    model_validate · model_dump · model_json_schema

Nothing else. If you finish these you can start Lab 1 without opening the docs.

Each exercise has a TODO and a check. Run the file; it tells you which ones
pass. No API key needed — this is pure Pydantic and costs nothing.

WHY THIS MATTERS, in one paragraph. In Lab 1 you ask a language model to turn a
messy support ticket into a structured record. The model returns text. Your
program needs a typed object. Pydantic is the thing in between: it is where you
write down what you are willing to accept, and where you find out — loudly and
in one place — that you did not get it. Everything in this file is a tool for
saying "no" precisely.

Pydantic's whole idea: annotate the fields, and it enforces them at runtime.

That middle line surprises people. Pydantic coerces where it is unambiguous.
It is a validator, not a type checker.
